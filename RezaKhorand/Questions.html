            <label class="accordion-label" for="check1">Why has the seller decided to sell?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Knowing why the homeowner wants to sell can significantly inform your decision. If they’re selling because they’ve taken a new job in another city, they may be hoping to sell quickly and willing to lower the asking price. If they’re selling because there’s an issue with the house, you may be able to get a better deal or pass and avoid buying a house that can end up being a money pit. If they’re selling for a location reason—maybe school districts have gotten worse, crime statistics have increased, or the house is on a flood plain—you can factor those variables into your decision, too.</p>

            <label class="accordion-label" for="check2">How long has the house been on the market? </label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The length of time that a house has been on the market may indicate that the price is too high or be a sign that the property has a major issue. The answer to this question can help prospective home buyers determine whether the seller is desperate to sell and likely to accept a lower offer.</p>

            <label class="accordion-label" for="check3">What’s included in the sale?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>When buying a new home, it’s crucial to know what comes with the home purchase. It’s standard for most attached hardware to come with the house—like cabinets and faucets—but appliances may not. Ask the seller about refrigerators, ovens, washers and dryers, and backyard features, so you know what to expect if you decide to make the purchase.</p>

            <label class="accordion-label" for="check4">Has the house had any major renovations or additions?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Ensure the house is up to code before making an offer to avoid any big surprises when the home inspector does their walkthrough, or your lender conducts their appraisal. Securing information about any renovations or additions the seller has made (and whether they got the correct approval and permits) is vital because it’ll let you know if it’s a temporary DIY fix or completed by professionals and likely to last a while.</p>

            <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check5">
            <label class="accordion-label" for="check5">How old are the appliances?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Appliances—and major systems like air conditioning or heating—have finite lifespans, and it’s important to know how old they are to gauge how much longer they’ll work before they need replacement. Ask to see warranties, if the seller has them. Most appliances (ovens, refrigerators, washers, dryers) and systems (HVACs, furnaces, and water heaters) can last 10 to 15 years if they’re well-maintained. If the house’s appliances are at high risk of failing soon, you may be able to negotiate a better deal or have the seller cover some of the closing costs to make up for the price of repairs or replacement</p>

            <label class="accordion-label" for="check6">How much do the house’s monthly fees usually cost?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>While you may have an idea of your monthly mortgage payments, it’s essential to factor in other costs like monthly utility bills, property taxes, and fees from the homeowners association (HOA). Ask the seller’s real estate agent to break down these potential costs.</p>

            <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check7">
            <label class="accordion-label" for="check7">Does the house have a history of insurance claims?</label>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Past insurance claims can reveal a lot about a house—for instance, if it’s been damaged by weather or broken into consistently. Request a copy of a comprehensive loss underwriting exchange (CLUE) to see any insurance activity from the past seven years and ask the seller’s agent about past insurance claims.</p>
